        		<h1>Welcome To Mission SUIIT!</h1>
				<p>Hello Everyone! <br>
Welcome to the project site of “Mission SUIIT”. It’s a project launched by 4 of the final year B.Tech Computer science undergrads of SUIIT. 
The students having a stake in the project building process are:

<br>
<ul>
 <li> <b> Biswaranjan Das </b> </li>
 <li> <b>Priyadarshini Jyotishi</b> </li>
 <li> <b>Nikita Padhan</b> </li>
 <li> <b>Sourav Kumar Sahoo</b> </li>
</ul>
<br>	

This mission is getting carried out under the supervision of Ms. Sanju Parida. We've got into the action from the first week itself since the team was formed on Aug 10, 2019. Although having the flexibility to work as individuals, we took the call to get together onto a single platform as the great things in the world are built in a team! 
In this context, I’d like to note a famous quote on the incredible power of a small team:
			
<q> “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has!”  - Margaret Mead </q>
