<h3><u> The Guide</u></h3>
This mission is getting carried out under the supervision of <b> Ms. Sanju Parida </b>. We've got into the action from the first week itself since the inception of the team on <b> Aug 10, 2019 </b>. 

<h3><u>Why We Stand Together?</u></h3>
<p>Although having the flexibility to work as individuals, we took the call to get together onto a single platform as the great things in the world are built in a team! In this context, I’d like to note a famous quote on the incredible power of a small team: </p>
			
<i> “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has!”  - Margaret Mead  </i>
