## Why We Stand Together?
Although having the flexibility to work as individuals, we took the call to get together onto a single platform as the great things in the world are built in a team! In this context, I’d like to note a famous quote on the incredible power of a small team:

```Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has!``` **-Margaret Mead**
